GameBase Renderer
-----------------

Using the code developed by Mozilla (and Little Worlds) for BrowserQuest as a base, GameBase is intended to be collection of reusable components for the creation of top-down HTML5 browser based games.

The renderer component is designed to display tile based maps using layered canvases. Layers can be of various types, such as a terrain layer (indicating it is static and should be drawn once) or a dynamic layer.
